# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added V3.4 **Native Masked — exact continuation** as the recommended/default exact chunk-continuation mechanism using ComfyUI Core MiniMax H3 per-token denoise masks from PR #15375.
- Preserved **Guide / Motion Context** as a separate softer continuation method and kept V2/V3.3 workflow behavior on the legacy guide/RoPE path.
- Reused accepted generated H3 video/audio latents directly for protected target prefixes without decode/re-encode, with exact 39-frame/65-audio-step generated-AV boundary validation.
- Kept Driving Audio authoritative by protecting video only in that mode, retaining absolute source-audio guide slices, and preserving final source-audio assembly behavior.
- Versioned Native Masked continuation chunk fingerprints/plans so Run Storage never silently reuses Guide chunks as Native Masked while preserving reusable chunk 1 where possible.
- Kept Spectrum Interop API v1 Actual Prefix 2 independent of the old layout rewrite.
- Added regression coverage and documentation for native masks, temporal mapping, references/keyframes, restartability, assembly, and compatibility requirements.

- Added persistent Video Reference conditioning with Efficient 0.4 MP, Balanced 0.6 MP, and Match Output modes.
- Included Driving Audio and Video Reference identities in Run Storage contracts.

- Added V3.4 runtime, driving-audio, and context diagnostics coverage.

## 3.3.0

- Promoted Timeline Video to a stable public node with chunk-local slicing and a 0.4 MP default.
- Added `H3 Continuum Assemble + Seam` with stable Audio Seam Auto and guarded Video Seam Auto defaults.

## 3.2.4

- Added native MiniMax H3 Reference Audio 1 conditioning with deferred Audio VAE encoding.
- Matched Core's permissive prompt handling by warning instead of stopping on unavailable Picture or Audio tags.

- Kept checkpoint classification as diagnostics without automatic MODEL switching.

## 3.2.1

- Added T2VA, First/Last Frame, FL2VA and persistent two-image Reference conditioning to the production sampler.
- Added crash-safe raw AV Run Storage, automatic resume, deterministic Revisions and partial regeneration.
- Combined ordered upstream graph fingerprints with runtime MODEL/CLIP/VAE weight probes for fail-closed reuse.
- Added per-chunk SHA-256 verification and rejected Regenerate From when Run Storage is disabled.
- Added official MiniMax H3 Sigma Shift graph-contract support.
- Updated CI dependencies, Windows runtime verification and package metadata for V3.2.1.
- Standardized project licensing as MIT.
- Kept sampling, Continuation, Spectrum Interop and external Core VAE decode semantics unchanged.

## 2.1.7

- Added the compact static `H3 Continuum Sampler` facade over the unchanged V2 execution core.
- Added Clip Overrides, Advanced, and Result pack helper nodes.
- Preserved `H3ContinuumSamplerV2` as a Legacy/Core workflow compatibility node.
- Removed the frontend display controller and all dynamic socket, proxy-widget, DOM, resize, and serialization workarounds.
- Kept State, Session, Prompt Plan, Sampling, Native Continuity, and Spectrum Interop contracts unchanged.

## 2.1.6

- Rebuilt the Sampler V2 frontend as one Vue-aware display controller.
- Removed the Individual Clip Overrides accordion; only active Clip Prompt sockets are shown.
- Kept connected out-of-range Clip Prompt sockets visible when chunks is reduced.
- Added one Advanced Settings control; connected advanced sockets stay visible while collapsed.
- Removed fixed node-height handling and all input/output add/remove UI folding.
- Kept backend socket/widget order, types, serialization, State/Session/Prompt Plan schemas, sampling, and Spectrum Interop unchanged.
- Exposed show_preview as a per-node basic control and removed the duplicate global preview setting.

## 2.0.1

- Fixed the bundled V2 example workflow widget serialization for `base_seed` with `control_after_generate`.
- Added an in-memory migration guard for the malformed 2.0.0 example where later widgets were shifted by one slot (`diagnostics` arrived as `0`).
- Preserved valid 2.0.0 workflows and all V1/V2 node identifiers and schemas.
- Added regression coverage for the legacy shifted-widget signature.

## 2.0.0

- Added production **H3 Continuum Sampler V2** for integrated N-chunk generation.
- Kept the V1 continuation algorithm and all V1 node identifiers unchanged.
- Added Fixed, List, and Timeline prompt planning plus a connectable Prompt Plan node.
- Cached each unique Qwen prompt conditioning before H3 sampling.
- Reused one externally accelerator-patched MODEL, sampler, and sigma schedule across all chunks.
- Deferred Video/Audio VAE decoding until every H3 chunk finished.
- Captured full raw AV chunk latents and next-state tails on CPU before decoding.
- Removed the second device-to-host state transfer by deriving next-state tails from committed CPU entries.
- Added conservative latent-motion Auto Context selection with 5/22/39-frame profiles.
- Added deterministic independent 64-bit per-chunk seeds and reroll nonces.
- Added V2 Session resume, accepted-prefix reuse, branch-safe reroll, and atomic safetensors/JSON persistence.
- Added exact cumulative audio sample-boundary assembly to prevent long-chain rounding drift.
- Added exact total-duration correction.
- Added single-allocation decoded IMAGE assembly and preflight RAM safety checks.
- Added Basic and Full diagnostics, including video overlap MAE/PSNR and audio correlation/boundary jump.
- Added optional V1 State entry point and V2 Session-to-V1 State conversion.
- Added V2 public API modules and regression/orchestration tests.
- Updated installer runtime verification for all ten registered nodes.

## 1.0.1

- Fixed a false strict-compatibility failure when Sol-Attn wraps MiniMax H3
  `PackedLayout.__init__` with `*args` / `**kwargs` for Morton/span tracking.
- Strict checking still fails closed when the native H3 constructor genuinely
  removes required positional or keyword capabilities.
- Added regression tests for the native signature, Sol-Attn forwarding wrapper,
  and a genuinely incompatible constructor.

## 1.0.0

- Added **H3 Continuum Join** for initial and continuation clips.
- Added direct native video/audio latent state capture with 5/22/39-frame profiles.
- Represented continuation history as one native H3 `video` / `video_audio` reference block.

# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 3.4.2

- Adapted upstream's V3.4 FL2VA terminal merge as an explicit physical-decode-group contract: 2×5-second FL2VA uses one Core-equivalent initial sample, while 3+ chunk merging is limited to Guide / Motion Context with the validated Balanced 22-frame prefix.
- Preserved the fork's Native Masked 39-video-frame / 65-audio-step generated-AV boundary by retaining per-logical-chunk sampling for long Native Masked sequences.
- Made terminal Run Storage pairs atomic, versioned their fingerprints and plan markers, and required bit-exact latent overlap before reconstructing one physical Core VAE decode unit.
- Added First/Last Frame images to hybrid Qwen presentation while preserving public Reference Image `<Picture 1>` through `<Picture 8>` numbering and keeping Last Frame out of non-final conditioning.
- Added explicit V3.4 assembler timeline output modes: exact requested duration remains the default, while Natural retained timeline (Refinement) exposes the complete physical retained timeline for downstream global tracking/refinement.
- Added `H3 Continuum Finalize Duration V3.4` so downstream refinement can operate on the natural timeline and then reapply Continuum's validated exact target-frame, final-frame, generated/Driving Audio, and final-anchor duration policy once after stitch-back.
- Added strict natural-timeline/finalizer validation so already-compacted input cannot be silently trimmed a second time.
- Corrected Timeline documentation so section headers and prompt text match the parser's line-based syntax.

## 3.4.1

- Completed the post-v3.4.0 V3.4 hotfix set: package registration/runtime-contract synchronization, Core-aligned prompt validation, finalized package metadata, and conditional-widget visibility are all included in this release.
- Fixed hybrid First/Last/Reference conditioning so Reference Images remain additive to the temporal keyframe mode instead of suppressing First Frame or Last Frame semantics. Native Masked and Guide continuation preserve the correct keyframe/reference composition, Run Storage fingerprints keyframes and references independently, and the V3.4 facade supports the full ordered Reference Image 1..8 range.
- Added tested-main GitHub Release automation and Comfy Registry publishing with the expanded Python/runtime validation matrix used by the current V3.4 package.
- Added V3.4 **Native Masked — exact continuation** as the recommended/default exact chunk-continuation mechanism using ComfyUI Core MiniMax H3 per-token denoise masks from PR #15375.
- Preserved **Guide / Motion Context** as a separate softer continuation method and kept V2/V3.3 workflow behavior on the legacy guide/RoPE path.
- Reused accepted generated H3 video/audio latents directly for protected target prefixes without decode/re-encode, with exact 39-frame/65-audio-step generated-AV boundary validation.
- Kept Driving Audio authoritative by protecting video only in that mode, retaining absolute source-audio guide slices, and preserving final source-audio assembly behavior.
- Versioned Native Masked continuation chunk fingerprints/plans so Run Storage never silently reuses Guide chunks as Native Masked while preserving reusable chunk 1 where possible.
- Kept Spectrum Interop API v1 Actual Prefix 2 independent of the old layout rewrite.
- Added exact per-chunk `refine_state` output for learned-latent sampler-2 workflows. Each state carries a fresh clone of the exact Continuum MODEL wrapper plus the exact positive CONDITIONING used for that chunk.
- Restored the exact captured Native Masked video/audio denoise-mask members onto the matching split LATENT outputs when refinement-state capture is requested, keeping chunk N's video, audio, model, conditioning and masks aligned.
- Made refinement capture output-link-driven so ordinary Continuum workflows keep the previous runtime/memory behavior when `refine_state` is unused.
- Kept Run Storage fail-closed for exact refinement when a stored prefix would leave raw runtime MODEL/CONDITIONING state unavailable; use Run Storage Off or regenerate from Chunk 1 for an exact refinement run.
- Added regression coverage and documentation for native masks, temporal mapping, references/keyframes, restartability, assembly, refinement-state capture, output ordering, Run Storage alignment and compatibility requirements.
- Completed coordinated real CUDA validation with the integrated MiniMax H3 latent upscaler/refiner, Spectrum and DiffAid. The exact handoff ran through target-resolution sampler 2 successfully, and the validated three-step refinement used `actual -> forecast -> actual` with user-confirmed impeccable media quality.
